Welcome to Smart Answers!<br>
We’d love to help you, but the reality is that not every question gets answered. To improve your chances, here are some tips:<br>
<h5>Be on-topic</h5><br>
Our community is defined by a specific set of topics in the help center;If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful, relevant answer.
Make it relevant to others  <br>
<h5>Be specific</h5><br>
If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer.<br>
<h5>Keep an open mind</h5><br>
The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn’t mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn’t always possible. <br></p>
